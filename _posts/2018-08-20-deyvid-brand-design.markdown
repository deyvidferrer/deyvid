Personal logo/Brand that I've designed over the last few months. This one started off in a sketchbook, on a napkin, or on a post-it note, and miraculously made its way to my computer. This is where they are brought to life with vector magic.


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Deyvid Ferrer')
#=> prints 'Hi, Deyvid Ferrer' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
